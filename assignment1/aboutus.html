          Welcome to Chris High School!  We are excited that you have chosen CHS. CHS is accredited through the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and has been recognized by U.S. News and World Report as one of the best high schools in the nation, having received a Silver Award in four of the last five years. We are looking forward to our WASC Mid-Cylcle Visit this school year to share our progreee towards our campus and student goals.  We look forward to sharing this over the next school year.<br>
          Our faculty, staff, and administration are focused on providing a quality learning experience for all students through the various curricular and extracurricular opportunities available. Our focus as educators will continue to be on preparing students for college and careers by developing essential skills and behaviors in a safe, supportive environment. Our teachers provide relevant, engaging content while building strong relationships with all students and families. As a result of this commitment, our class of 2017 earned over $7 million in scholarships and grants. We plan on continuing this trend over the upcoming years!<br>
          Our partnership with our families and community is an integral part of the success of CHS. We encourage you to to become involved, whether through our Parent-Teacher Student Association (PTSA), English Learner Advisory Committee (ELAC), School Site Council (SSC) or one of the many committees or support groups aimed at improving our campus. Your feedback and support are essential to our continued improvement. I am excited about the partnerships we will build this school year.
